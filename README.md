# Refactoring Mastery
This repository includes an HTML file with stylized edits using a CSS file. It is my first assignment for the class! I attempted to go above the parameters of the expectations, however I was getting a little ahead of myself! This is a very basic .html.

[Finished website!](https://lilniz.github.io/Assignments/)

The HTML file can be found in the root.

The CSS file can be found in; Assets/css.

Images referenced and used are found within; Assets/images.
